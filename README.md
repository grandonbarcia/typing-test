# Typing-Test

A simple typing test that prompts the user with a quote and input field. When the test starts, users type out the quote in the input field until they are done. After, they prompted with their WPM (Words per Minute)

## Motivation

This app is inspired by the [keyhero](hhttps://www.keyhero.com/free-typing-test/) app. This is another typing test app that givers users stats on their typing skills. I wanted to challenge myself to make a similar app. 

## Tech/framework used

Built with:
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
* [React-Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap)


## Launching the Server
